He is the National Convener of the Aam Aadmi party (AAP), a political party that was launched in November 2012. Kejriwal had been a social activist long before he entered the world of politics and his main motive of venturing into this field was so that he could serve the country. As a teenager he had trouble deciding which career to pursue: medicine or engineering. Eventually he decided to go for engineering and set his eyes on entering the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). Stubbornly refusing to give the entrance exam at any other college, he appeared only for the IIT entrance—and cleared it at the first try. As a student he realized that his passion lay not in making money, but in serving his country. He started working for the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) and also became involved in social activism. His involvement in the ‘Parivartan’ movement earned him a Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership. Later on he became involved with Anna Hazare in his India Against Corruption (IAC) movement following which he launched the Aam Aadmi Party. He became the Chief Minister of Delhi in December 2013 but resigned after just 49 days.<br />

He received job offers from Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Gas Authority of India, but had set his mind on getting into Tata Steel, a company that had rejected him in their interview round.
